			Between Public Health and Social Welfare: How the Politics of State-building Uncoupled Maternal and Infant Health

	  		This project examines how modern states regulated childbearing, childbirth, and childrearing. Throughout most of human history, maternal and infant mortality rates were appallingly high. The early twentieth century witnessed unprecedented state interventions in maternal and infant health that laid the groundwork for modern states to improve public health and promote social welfare. This project examines this understudied process of state-building, asking why states treated mothers and infants differently despite a high political and social consensus to protect both mothers and infants. 
	  		<br>
	  		<br>
	  		The primary case is the United States (1900-1935). The United State performed well in reducing the infant mortality rate but fell far behind in reducing the maternal mortality rate. Public health officials mourned that the United States was one of the world’s most dangerous place to birth a baby. High maternal mortality is still a problem in the United States today. 
	  		<br>
	  		<br>
	  		This project shows how the jurisdictional conflict between two frontiers of state expansion—building public health infrastructure and establishing the welfare state— and the politics involved in the conflict, uncoupled the otherwise naturally connected maternal and infant health. This project lies at the intersection of public health, state-building, and the welfare state.

	  		I propose a layered Dirichlet process hidden Markov model to detect heterogeneity across units and over time simultaneously with TSCS data. One application of this method is to reevaluate the argument that Western aid promoted democracy in Africa. The model automatically detects the end of the Cold War as the dividing point, identifies a subgroup of former Soviet Unions’ allies, and shows that the argument only holds in this subgroup after the Cold War.

	  		We propose a novel nonparametric Bayesian model to examine gradual changes of grouping patterns by introducing a time dynamic to the Dirichlet process mixture model. The proposed method categorizes units into groups and allows the group membership to evolve as a Markov process. We use the method to analyze the gradual reverse of party positions on civil rights in the United States from the 1930s to the 1960s.
